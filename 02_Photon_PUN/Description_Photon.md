# Photon PUN Implementation

## Description
This implementation leverages the Photon Unity Networking (PUN) framework to build a cloud-based multiplayer game using Unity. Photon provides a comprehensive and scalable networking solution, allowing developers to focus more on game logic and less on the underlying network infrastructure. By integrating Photon into the MUD game, we can utilize its matchmaking, room management, and player synchronization features to create a seamless multiplayer experience without the need for a custom server.

## What We Are Doing
- **Unity Client:**
  - Integrating Photon PUN into the Unity project to manage multiplayer interactions.
  - Implementing client-side logic to connect to Photon’s cloud servers, join or create game rooms, and synchronize player actions with other connected clients.

- **Photon Cloud Server:**
  - Using Photon’s cloud-based server infrastructure to handle matchmaking, room management, and player data synchronization.
  - Offloading server management and scaling concerns to Photon, which automatically handles multiple instances and load balancing.

- **Photon Integration:**
  - Establishing connections to Photon’s servers and managing game sessions using PUN's APIs.
  - Implementing real-time synchronization of game objects and player states across all clients connected to the same game room.

- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Analyzing the performance of the Photon implementation in terms of latency, synchronization accuracy, and scalability.
  - Comparing Photon’s performance with the custom WebSocket implementation and Unity’s Netcode to highlight strengths and potential limitations.

## Conclusion
The Photon PUN implementation offers a robust, scalable, and easy-to-use networking solution for multiplayer games. By abstracting away the complexities of server management, Photon allows for faster development and easier scalability, making it a strong candidate for projects where cloud-based multiplayer functionality is desired.
