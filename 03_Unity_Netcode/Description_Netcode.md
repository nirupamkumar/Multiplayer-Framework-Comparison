# Unity Netcode Implementation

## Description
This implementation uses Unity’s Netcode for GameObjects to create a multiplayer game directly within the Unity ecosystem. Unity Netcode provides a first-party solution for building both client-hosted and dedicated server multiplayer games, offering tight integration with Unity's existing tools and workflows. By using Unity Netcode in the MUD game, we can leverage its built-in synchronization, messaging, and networking features to create a multiplayer experience that is both efficient and deeply integrated with Unity’s capabilities.

## What We Are Doing
- **Unity Client & Server:**
  - Utilizing Unity Netcode to build both the client and server directly within the Unity engine.
  - Implementing client-side logic to handle player inputs, game state synchronization, and server communication, all within the Unity project.
  - Configuring the Unity project to function as a server, either in a client-hosted (peer-to-peer) or dedicated server setup.

- **Unity Netcode Integration:**
  - Integrating Unity’s Netcode APIs to manage real-time multiplayer interactions, including player movement, object synchronization, and game state updates.
  - Using Unity’s built-in tools to monitor and profile network performance, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay.

- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Evaluating the efficiency of Unity Netcode in handling multiplayer interactions, focusing on latency, object synchronization, and network load.
  - Comparing Unity Netcode’s performance with the custom WebSocket and Photon implementations to assess its suitability for different types of multiplayer games.

## Conclusion
Unity Netcode for GameObjects provides a fully integrated networking solution within the Unity engine, offering a streamlined approach to multiplayer game development. Its close integration with Unity’s existing tools makes it a powerful option for developers looking to build multiplayer games with minimal external dependencies. This implementation serves as a comparison point to understand the trade-offs between using a first-party solution versus third-party options like Photon or custom architectures.
